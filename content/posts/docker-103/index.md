**Buiding a Pipeline Using Containers**

This exercise demonstrates how to build a pipeline composed of independent containers whose goal is to train a machine learning model on-demand.

### Dockerfile for `app`

**Path:** `./app/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as base
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install Flask
RUN pip install Flask requests

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Explanation:**
- This Dockerfile starts with the official Python image and installs Flask along with the `requests` library.
- It sets the working directory inside the container as `/app`.
- Copies all files from the current directory (`.`) into the container's `/app` directory.
- Exposes port `5000` to allow communication with the Flask application.
- Finally, it specifies the command to run the Flask application using `CMD`.

---

### Python Script for `app`

**Path:** `./app/app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    response = requests.get('http://train:5000')
    return jsonify(message="App received response from Train",
                   train_response=response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**Explanation:**
- This Python script defines a Flask application.
- It creates a route `/` which sends a request to the `train` service at port `5000`.
- Upon receiving the response, it returns a JSON message indicating receipt of the response from `Train`.

---

### Dockerfile for `preprocess`

**Path:** `./preprocess/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as base
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install Flask
RUN pip install Flask mysql-connector-python

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to the `app` Dockerfile, this one installs Flask along with `mysql-connector-python`.
- It sets the working directory as `/app` and copies all files into it.
- Exposes port `5000` for communication.
- Specifies the command to run the Flask application.

---

### Python Script for `preprocess`

**Path:** `./preprocess/app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import mysql.connector

app = Flask(__name__)

# Database connection configuration
db_config = {
    'host': 'db',          # Service name in Docker Compose network
    'user': 'my_user',
    'password': 'my_password',
    'database': 'train_database'
}

# Function to fetch data from the database
def get_data():
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM trains')
        data = cursor.fetchall()
        print(data)
        return data
    except mysql.connector.Error as error:
        return f"Error: {error}"
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Fetch data from the database
    data = get_data()
    data_json = {
        "data": data
    }
    return jsonify(message="Preprocess received response from Database",
                   database_response=data_json)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**Explanation:**
- This script sets up a Flask application.
- It defines a route `/` which connects to the database (`db`) to fetch data from the `trains` table.
- The fetched data is returned as a JSON response.

---

### Dockerfile for `train`

**Path:** `./train/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as base
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install Flask
RUN pip install Flask requests

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to the previous Dockerfiles, this one installs Flask and sets up the working directory.
- Exposes port `5000` for communication with the Flask application.

---

### Python Script for `train`

**Path:** `./train/app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    response = requests.get('http://preprocess:5000')
    return jsonify(message="Train received response from Preprocess",
                   preprocess_response=response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**Explanation:**
- This script defines a Flask application.
- It creates a route `/` which sends a request to the `preprocess` service at port `5000`.
- Upon receiving the response, it returns a JSON message indicating receipt of the response from `Preprocess`.

---

### Dockerfile for `db`

**Path:** `./db/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use the official MySQL image as base
FROM mysql:8.3.0

# Copy the SQL script to create the table into the container
COPY init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

**Explanation:**
- This Dockerfile sets up the MySQL database container.
- It uses the official MySQL image and copies the SQL script for table creation into the container's initialization directory.

---

### SQL Script for Initializing `db`

**Path:** `./db/init.sql`

```sql
-- Create the database if it doesn't exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS train_database;

-- Use the created database
USE train_database;

-- Create table for trains
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trains (
    train_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    train_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    departure_time INT NOT NULL,
    arrival_time INT NOT NULL,
    departure_station VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    arrival_station VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Generate and insert sample train data
INSERT INTO trains (train_name, departure_time, arrival_time, departure_station, arrival_station)
SELECT
    CONCAT('Train ', numbers.n) AS train_name,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 86400) AS departure_time,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 86400) AS arrival_time,
    CONCAT('Station ', FLOOR(RAND() * 1000)) AS departure_station,
    CONCAT('Station ', FLOOR(RAND() * 1000)) AS arrival_station
FROM (
    SELECT 
        (a.n + b.n * 10 + c.n * 100) AS n
    FROM
        (SELECT 0 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) AS a,
        (SELECT 0 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) AS b,
        (SELECT 0 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) AS c
) AS numbers
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Explanation:**
- This SQL script initializes the MySQL database.
- It creates a database named `train_database` if it doesn't exist and switches to it.
- Then it creates a table `trains` with columns for train details.
- Finally, it generates and inserts sample train data into the table.

---

### Docker Compose Configuration

**Path:** `./docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "5001:5000"
    networks:
      - my_network

  train:
    build: ./train
    networks:
      - my_network

  preprocess:
    build: ./preprocess
    networks:
      - my_network

  db:
    build: ./db
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: train_database
      MYSQL_USER: my_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: my_password
    networks:
      - my_network
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db_data:
```

**Explanation:**
- This YAML file defines a multi-container environment using Docker Compose.
- It specifies services for `app`, `train`, `preprocess`, and `db`.
- Each service is built from its respective Dockerfile.
- The `db` service also configures environment variables for MySQL and mounts a volume for persistent data storage.
- All services are connected to a custom network named `my_network`.
